# ShadowSwap
You control a small character in a 2D platforming level, but your shadow exists in parallel — mirrored vertically or horizontally. Pressing a button instantly swaps your position with the shadow’s. The shadow’s environment is slightly different — platforms might exist there but not in your world, enemies might be absent in the shadow world, etc.
